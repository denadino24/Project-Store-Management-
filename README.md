My project for Unit 2 APCSA.
# Unit 2 - Store Management Project

## Introduction

You are opening a new business in your community! Businesses often need programs to manage the products and services they offer and track orders and requests from customers. Your goal is to create a store management system for your business.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming and class structure and design to create your store management system:
- **Create a class hierarchy** – Develop a superclass that represents a product or service your business offers and one or more subclasses that extend the superclass to represent more specific types of products or services.
- **Declare instance variables** – Declare instance variables in the superclass that are shared with the subclasses and instance variables in the subclasses that are not shared with the superclass.
- **Write constructors** – Write no-argument and parameterized constructors in the superclass and subclasses. Subclass constructors use the super keyword to call the superclass constructor.
- **Implement accessor and mutator methods** – Write accessor and mutator methods for instance variables that should be accessible and/or modifiable from outside of the class.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write toString() methods in the superclass and subclasses that return information about the state of an object.

## Description

In this project, I created a store using methods, instance variables, classes, contructors, arguments, the this keyord, expressions, variables, and attributes. I had to create a class hierachy, declare instance variables, write constructors, use accessors, use mutator methods, and use the toString() method for this project. I created a Asian Grocery store that was a super class and was extended by the products that were sold which included asian snacks and dishes. I chose this topic because I really enjoy asian food since it is apart of my culture. If I had user input, the user would interact with the program by clicking on the run button, seeing a greeting message, seeing all of the food options and the information that comes with it. The information includes hether or not the food is a snack or a dish, the price of the dish, the name of the dish, whether the dish is hot or cold for the dish option, and whether or not the snack is sweet for the snack option. In the end, the user is met with a goodbye and gratitude message.
